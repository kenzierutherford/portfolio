<h2> Robots and Ethics</h2>
<h3>July 17th, 2017</h3>
<p>My idea of what robot is has changed. It used to simply be a machine that was able to perform tasks and interact with humans. My idea of what a robot is had been skewed by the presence of technology and sciene fiction in society. But now, i know that robots and be simpler and not act at such a high level. As for the future, I think robots will do amazing things and will have the ability to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>I enjoyed doing the circuits and beginning to work with the robots but I was a little confused as to how it worked. I like working in a group on projects like this becuase it allows me to share my ideas with other people and grow intellectualy.</p>
